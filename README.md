# Sport League App

This is a simple app to manage sport leagues.

## Why ?

Because I wanted to learn how to build a full stack app with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL. and other technologies.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
